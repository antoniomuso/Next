# *Next!* A tool to remote control your presentations

*Next!* allows you to change slide without using mouse and keyboard or any other kind of device that requires physical contact. Exploiting the Microsoft Kinect, it enables you to use both gestures and voice commands to control your presentations.

**Watch a demo [here](https://youtu.be/r-WBsEpnS9Q).**

## Gestures
if you want to use gestures, there are two different gestures (*Finger Snap* or *Rotate right*) to go to the next slide and one (*Rotate left*) to go back to the previous one.
### Finger Snap Gesture
You can snap your finger to go on.
